__This is my personal configuration for my Arch installation in my desktop. Includes configuration for i3, i3status, neovim, and some custom scripts for Arch (volume control, connect to all paired bluetooth devices, etc.)__

## TODO
- [ ] Modify rofi config, add quit hotkey.
- [ ] Add texlab as lsp.
- [ ] Add shortcut to execute script to take screenshots.
- [ ] Fix octave syntax highlight.
- [ ] Add more plugs for octave.
- [ ] Improve configPlot with a different fontsize for the title and another one for the axis.

## Dependencies
- arduino-cli

## Problems
if the for some reason (i.e system update) the i3 it's replaced by kwin, do as says [here](https://maxnatt.gitlab.io/posts/kde-plasma-with-i3wm/)
